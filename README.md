Credits: 
- https://github.com/XanOpiat/Python-CSGO-Cheat, learned from that cheat. A lot is C+P from there.
- https://github.com/Snaacky/Diamond Glow is C+P from there.

If you encounter any problems feel free to message me on discord: nex1233#9045.

I don't recommend using this cheat on a toaster. Cheat has 10-20% CPU usage on a ryzen 5 2600.

<ins> Is this undetected? Yes, it probably is. Don't use tools to convert this cheat to an .exe, let it run trough python. </ins>
