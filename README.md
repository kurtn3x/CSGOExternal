Credits: 
- https://github.com/XanOpiat/Python-CSGO-Cheat, learned from that cheat. A lot is C+P from there.
- https://github.com/Snaacky/Diamond Glow is C+P from there.

If you encounter any problems feel free to message me on discord: nex1233#9045.

I don't recommend using this cheat on a toaster. Cheat has 10-20% CPU usage on a ryzen 5 2600.

<ins> Is this undetected? Yes, it probably is. Don't use tools to convert this cheat to an .exe, let it run trough python. </ins>

## Installation:
#### - Download this repo as zip. Download Python 3.10 (recommended)
#### - go to the download directory and install the dependencies with ' pip install -r requirements.txt ' or manually install following dependencies: keyboard, mouse, PyQT5, requests, Pymem. If you encounter any errors manually install the dependencies and google the error messages.
#### - Start the main.py with python. (Either doubleclick and open with Python or command "python main.py") If you encounter any errors start the cheat over the cmd with the command "python main.py" and PM me the error.
#### - Run CSGO in windowed or fullscreen windowed setting, otherwise the overlay won't stay on top and you have to tab out to change settings.
