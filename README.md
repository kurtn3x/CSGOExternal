## Known Problems
#### - Map Brightness, Player FOV changes  have to be made while being in a map. After mapchange the settings have to be made again. Will not be fixed.
#### - The configloader is quite cancer because i didnt intent to make one while starting to write this cheat.
#### - Closing the cheat without the Close Button in Misc Settings will keep any changes written to the games memory. This includes Map Brightness, Model Brightness, FOV Changer, Chams and Nohands
#### - Enabling nohands works fine, but turning it off sometimes doesnt return to your old model.
