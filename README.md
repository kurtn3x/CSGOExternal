Credits: 
- https://github.com/XanOpiat/Python-CSGO-Cheat, learned from that cheat. A lot is C+P from there.
- https://github.com/Snaacky/Diamond Glow is C+P from there.

<ins> Is this undetected? Yes, it probably is. Don't use tools to convert this cheat to an .exe, let it run trough python. </ins>

## Installation:
#### - Download this repo as zip and unpack it somewhere. Download Python 3.10 (recommended) make sure to add Python as a PATH Variable during Installation.  
#### - Install the dependencies with the following command in your CMD: 
pip install keyboard mouse pyqt5 requests pymem 
#### - Start the main.py with python. (Either doubleclick and open with Python or command "python main.py").
#### - Run CSGO in windowed or fullscreen windowed setting, otherwise the overlay won't stay on top and you have to tab out to change settings.
#### - If the Cheat doesn't work try restarting it. If there are new offsets the cheat may still be using the old ones on the first run.
#### Tested on Windows 10 and Windows 11 using Python 3.10.
